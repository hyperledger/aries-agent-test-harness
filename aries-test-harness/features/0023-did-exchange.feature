Feature: RFC 0023 Establishing Connections with DID Exchange
   In order establish a connection with two parties,
   As a responder or a requester,
   I want to use DID Exchange(RFC0023) and Out of Band(RFC0434) protocols to accomplish this.


   @T001-RFC0023 @critical @AcceptanceTest
   Scenario: Establish a connection with DID Exchange between two agents with an explicit invitation
      Given we have "2" agents
         | name | role      |
         | Acme | requester |
         | Bob  | responder |
      When "Bob" sends an explicit invitation
      And "Acme" receives the invitation
      And "Acme" sends the request to "Bob"
      And "Bob" receives the request
      And "Bob" sends a response to "Acme"
      And "Acme" receives the response
      And "Acme" sends complete to "Bob"
      Then "Acme" and "Bob" have a connection

   @T002-RFC0023 @critical @AcceptanceTest
   Scenario: Establish a connection with DID Exchange between two agents with an explicit invitation with role reversal

      And "Acme" sends a response to "Bob"
