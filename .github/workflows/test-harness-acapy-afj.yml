# RUNSET_NAME: "ACA-PY to AFJ"
# Scope: AIP 1.0
# Exceptions: Revocation
#
# Summary
#
# This runset uses the current main branch of ACA-Py for all of the agents except Bob (holder),
# which uses the master branch of Aries Framework JavaScript. The runset covers all of the AIP 1.0 tests
# except those that are known **not** to work with the Aries Framework JavaScript as the holder,
# notably those that involve revocation.
#
# Current
# 
# Only about half of the tests are currently running. The issues seem to be related to the set of tags
# of the test cases being run as a number of the revocation tests are running and shouldn't be. As well,
# the tests with the holder proposing a proof are not running, as that feature is not supported in AFJ.
# 
# *Status Note Updated: 2021.03.08*
