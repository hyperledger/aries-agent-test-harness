# RUNSET_NAME: "AFJ to AF-.NET"
# Scope: AIP 1.0
# Exceptions: Revocation and Proof Proposals
# 
# Summary
#
# This runset uses the current main branch of Aries Framework - JavaScript for all of the agents except for Bob (the Holder), which
# uses Aries Framework .NET. The runset executes all of the AIP 1.0 tests that are expected to be pass given the two state of the
# two frameworks involved. Tests involving revocation (not supported in Aries Framework - JavaScript) and proof proposals (not supported
# in Aries Framework .NET) are not executed.
#
# Current
# 
# All but one of the tests being executed in this runset are passing. The failure is being investigated.
